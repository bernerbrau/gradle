[[lazy_configuration]]
= Lazy Configuration

As a build grows in complexity, knowing when and where a particular value is configured can become difficult to reason about. Gradle provides several ways to manage this complexity using _lazy configuration_.

[[sec:lazy_properties]]
== Lazy properties

[NOTE]
====

The Provider API is currently <<feature_lifecycle.adoc#feature_lifecycle,incubating>>. Please be aware that the DSL and other configuration may change in later Gradle versions.

====

Gradle provides lazy properties, which delay the calculation of a property’s value until it’s actually required. These provide three main benefits to build script and plugin authors:

1. Build authors can wire together Gradle models without worrying when a particular property’s value will be known. For example, you may want to set the input source files of a task based on the source directories property of an extension but the extension property value isn't known until the build script or some other plugin configures them.
2. Build authors can wire an output property of a task into an input property of some other task and Gradle automatically determines the task dependencies based on this connection. Property instances carry information about which task, if any, produces their value.
3. Build authors can avoid resource intensive work during the configuration phase, which can have a large impact on build performance. For example, when a property value comes from parsing a file but is only used when functional tests are run, using a property to capture this means that the file is parsed only when the functional tests are run, but not when `clean` is run.

Gradle represents lazy properties with two interfaces:

* link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html[Provider] represents a value that can only be queried and cannot be changed.
** Properties with these types are read-only.
** The method link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html#get--[Provider.get()] returns the current value of the property.
** A `Provider` can be created by the factory method link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/ProviderFactory.html#provider-java.util.concurrent.Callable-[ProviderFactory.provider(Callable)].
** A `Provider` can be created from another `Provider` using link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html#map-org.gradle.api.Transformer-[Provider.map(Transformer)].
** Many other types extend `Provider` and can be used where-ever a `Provider` is required.
* link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html[Property] represents a value that can be queried and also changed.
** Properties with these types are configurable.
** `Property` extends the `Provider` interface.
** The method link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html#set-T-[Property.set(T)] specifies a value for the property, overwriting whatever value may have been present.
** The method link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html#set-org.gradle.api.provider.Provider-[Property.set(Provider)] specifies a `Provider` for the value for the property, overwriting whatever value may have been present. This allows you to wire together `Provider` and `Property` instances before the values are configured.
** A `Property` can be created by the factory method link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#property-java.lang.Class-[ObjectFactory.property(Class)].

Neither of these types nor their subtypes are intended to be implemented by a build script or plugin author.  Gradle provides several factory methods to create instances of these types. See the <<#sec:lazy_configuration_reference,Quick Reference>> for all of the types and factories available.

Lazy properties are intended to be passed around and only queried when required (usually, during the execution phase). For more information about the Gradle build phases, please see <<build_lifecycle.adoc#sec:build_phases,Build Lifecycle>>.

The following demonstrates a task with a read-only property and a configurable property:


.Using a read-only and configurable property
====
include::sample[dir="providers/propertyAndProvider/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="providers/propertyAndProvider/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

.Output of **`gradle greeting`**
----
> gradle greeting
include::{samplesPath}/providers/propertyAndProvider/usePropertyAndProvider.out[]
----

The `Greeting` task has a property of type `Property<String>` for the configurable part of the greeting and a property of type `Provider<String>` for the calculated, read-only, message. The calculated message is created from the greeting using the `map` method.

[NOTE]
====

Note that Gradle Groovy DSL will generate setter methods for each `Property`-typed property in a task implementation. These setter methods allow you to configure the property using the assignment (`=`) operator as a convenience.

Kotlin DSL conveniences will be added in a future release.

====

[[sec:creating_property_provider]]
== Creating a Property or Provider

If provider types are not intended to be implemented directly by build script or plugin authors, how do you create a new one? Gradle provides various factory APIs to create new instances of both link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html[Provider] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html[Property]:

- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/ProviderFactory.html#provider-java.util.concurrent.Callable-[ProviderFactory.provider(Callable)] instantiates a new `Provider`. An instance of the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/ProviderFactory.html[ProviderFactory] can be referenced from link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#getProviders--[Project.getProviders()] or by injecting `ProviderFactory` through a constructor or method.
- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#property-java.lang.Class-[ObjectFactory.property(java.lang.Class)] instantiates a new `Property`. An instance of the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html[ObjectFactory] can be referenced from link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#getObjects--[Project.getObjects()] or by injecting `ObjectFactory` through a constructor or method.

[NOTE]
====

There are no specific methods for creating a provider from a `groovy.lang.Closure`. When writing a plugin with Groovy, you can use the method that accepts a `java.util.concurrent.Callable` parameter. Groovy's `Closure` type extends `Callable`.

Similarly, when writing a plugin with Kotlin, the Kotlin compiler will take care of converting a Kotlin function into a `Callable`.

====

[[sec:working_with_files_in_lazy_properties]]
== Working with files and Providers

In <<working_with_files.adoc#working_with_files,Working with Files>>, we introduced four collection types for `File`-like objects:

.Collection of files recap
[%header%autowidth,compact]
|===
| Read-only Type | Configurable Type

| link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/FileCollection.html[FileCollection]
| link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/ConfigurableFileCollection.html[ConfigurableFileCollection]

| link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/FileTree.html[FileTree]
| link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/ConfigurableFileTree.html[ConfigurableFileTree]
|===

All of these types are also considered lazy types.

In this section, we are going to introduce more strongly typed models for a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/FileSystemLocation.html[FileSystemLocation]: link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/Directory.html[Directory] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/RegularFile.html[RegularFile]. These types shouldn't be confused with the standard Java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html[File] type as they tell Gradle to expect more specific values (a directory or a non-directory, regular file).

Gradle provides two specialized `Property` subtypes for dealing with these types: link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/RegularFileProperty.html[RegularFileProperty] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/DirectoryProperty.html[DirectoryProperty]. link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html[ObjectFactory] has methods to create these: link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#fileProperty--[ObjectFactory.fileProperty()] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#directoryProperty--[ObjectFactory.directoryProperty()].

A `DirectoryProperty` can also be used to create a lazily evaluated `Provider` for a `Directory` and `RegularFile` via link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/DirectoryProperty.html#dir-java.lang.String-[DirectoryProperty.dir(String)] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/DirectoryProperty.html#file-java.lang.String-[DirectoryProperty.file(String)] respectively. These methods create providers whose values are calculated relative to the location for the `DirectoryProperty` they were created from. The values returned from these providers will reflect changes to the `DirectoryProperty`.

.Using file and directory property
====
include::sample[dir="providers/fileAndDirectoryProperty/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="providers/fileAndDirectoryProperty/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

.Output of **`gradle print`**
[.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
----
> gradle print
include::{samplesPath}/providers/fileAndDirectoryProperty/workingWithFilesGroovy.out[]
----
.Output of **`gradle print`**
[.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
----
> gradle print
include::{samplesPath}/providers/fileAndDirectoryProperty/workingWithFilesKotlin.out[]
----

This example shows how `Provider` types can be used inside an extension. Lazy properties that represent the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html#org.gradle.api.Project:buildDir[Project.getBuildDir()] and link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html#org.gradle.api.Project:projectDir[Project.getProjectDir()] can be accessed through link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#getLayout--[Project.getLayout()] with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/ProjectLayout.html#getBuildDirectory--[ProjectLayout.getBuildDirectory()] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/ProjectLayout.html#getProjectDirectory--[ProjectLayout.getProjectDirectory()].

[[sec:working_with_task_dependencies_in_lazy_properties]]
== Working with task input and outputs and Providers

Many builds have several tasks connected together, where one task processes the outputs of another task as an input. For these outputs and inputs, we need to know their locations on the file system and appropriately configure each task to know where to look. This can be cumbersome if any of these values are configurable by a user or configured by multiple plugins.

The `Property` API makes this easier. As an example consider the following plugin with a producer and consumer task, which are wired together via inputs and outputs:

.Implicit task dependency
====
include::sample[dir="providers/implicitTaskDependency/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="providers/implicitTaskDependency/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

.Output of **`gradle consumer`**
[.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
----
> gradle consumer
include::{samplesPath}/providers/implicitTaskDependency/implicitTaskDependencyGroovy.out[]
----
.Output of **`gradle consumer`**
[.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
----
> gradle consumer
include::{samplesPath}/providers/implicitTaskDependency/implicitTaskDependencyKotlin.out[]
----

In the example above, the task outputs and inputs are connected before any location is defined. This is possible because the input and output properties use the `Provider` API. The output property and input property are created with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/mode/ObjectFactory.html#fileProperty--[ObjectFactory.fileProperty()] method. Values are only resolved when they are queried during task execution. The setters can be called at any time before the task is executed and the change will automatically affect all related input and output properties.

Another thing to note is the absence of any explicit task dependency. Task outputs represented using `Providers` keep track of which task produces their value, and using them as task inputs will implicitly add the correct task dependencies.

[[sec:working_with_collection]]
== Working with collection Providers

In this section, we are going to explore lazy collections. They work exactly like any other `Provider` and, just like file providers, they have additional modeling around them. There are two provider interfaces available, one for `List` values and another for `Set` values:

* For `List` values the interface is called link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/ListProperty.html[ListProperty]. You can create a new `ListProperty` using link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#listProperty-java.lang.Class-[ObjectFactory.listProperty(Class)] and specifying the element's type.
* For `Set` values the interface is called link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/SetProperty.html[SetProperty]. You can create a new `SetProperty` using link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#setProperty-java.lang.Class-[ObjectFactory.setProperty(Class)] and specifying the element's type.

This type of property allows you to overwrite the entire collection value with link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/HasMultipleValues.html#set-java.lang.Iterable-[HasMultipleValues.set(Iterable)] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/HasMultipleValues.html#set-org.gradle.api.provider.Provider-[HasMultipleValues.set(Provider)] or add new elements through the various `add` methods:

* link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/HasMultipleValues.html#add-T-[HasMultipleValues.add(T)]: Add a single concrete element to the collection
* link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/HasMultipleValues.html#add-org.gradle.api.provider.Provider-[HasMultipleValues.add(Provider)]: Add a lazily evaluated element to the collection
* link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/HasMultipleValues.html#addAll-org.gradle.api.provider.Provider-[HasMultipleValues.addAll(Provider)]: Add a lazily evaluated collection of elements to the list

Just like every `Provider`, the collection is calculated when link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html#get--[Provider.get()] is called. The following example show the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/ListProperty.html[ListProperty] in action:

.List property
====
include::sample[dir="providers/listProperty/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="providers/listProperty/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

.Output of **`gradle print`**
----
> gradle print
include::{samplesPath}/providers/listProperty/listProperty.out[]
----

[[sec:lazy_configuration_faqs]]
== Guidelines

This section will introduce guidelines to be successful with the Provider API. To see those guidelines in action, have a look at https://github.com/gradle-guides/gradle-site-plugin[gradle-site-plugin], a Gradle plugin demonstrating established techniques and practices for plugin development.

* The link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html[Property] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html[Provider] types have all of the overloads you need to query or configure a value. For this reason, you should follow the following guidelines:
** For configurable properties, expose the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html[Property] directly through a single getter.
** For non-configurable properties, expose an link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html[Provider] directly through a single getter.
* Avoid simplifying calls like `obj.getProperty().get()` and `obj.getProperty().set(T)` in your code by introducing additional getters and setters.
* When migrating your plugin to use providers, follow these guidelines:
** If it's a new property, expose it as a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html[Property] or link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html[Provider] using a single getter.
** If it's incubating, change it to use a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html[Property] or link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html[Provider] using a single getter.
** If it's a stable property, add a new link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html[Property] or link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/Provider.html[Provider] and deprecate the old one. You should wire the old getter/setters into the new property as appropriate.

[[sec:lazy_configuration_roadmap]]
== Future development

Going forward, new properties will use the Provider API. The Groovy Gradle DSL adds convenience methods to make the use of Providers mostly transparent in build scripts. Existing tasks will have their existing "raw" properties replaced by Providers as needed and in a backwards compatible way. New tasks will be designed with the Provider API.

The Provider API is <<feature_lifecycle.adoc#feature_lifecycle,incubating>>. Please create new issues at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/new[gradle/gradle] to report bugs or to submit use cases for new features.

[[sec:lazy_configuration_reference]]
== Provider Files API Reference
